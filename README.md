# Data-Structure-Assignment-5-Hash-Table

### Project Requirements:
1. The HashTable interface must have the following methods:
  - (a) public void insert(String key, T value)
  - (b) public void search(String key)
  - (c) public void delete(String key)
  - (d) public void toString()
2. Implement the LinearP robing, QuadraticP robing, DoubleHashing, and SeperateChaining. These classes must ”implement” the HashTable interface with appreciated functionalities as discussed in our lecture and chapter 10 - Hash Table of the textbook.
3. Must use the UnorderedArray from assignment 1, for implementing all four types of the Hash Table data structure. You may modify your previous implementation of the UnorderedArray class if needed.
4. All classes must be generic classes and have a constructor that takes an integer as an input param- eter and uses it to initialize the size of the array.
